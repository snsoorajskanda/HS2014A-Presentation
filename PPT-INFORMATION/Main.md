## HS2014A PPT - TAMIL NADU STATE 
Based on the PDF provided to us, I felt that the ppt could be structured like this: 

- An introduction as to how the TNSAPCC came into action. So the ppt can begin by giving info about NAPCC which I have collected.
- The timeline and how it lead to formation of TNSAPCC can be covered.
- Then few more slides describing the demography, economy and general conditions of TNS in order to make the listener understand the context of this policy.
- How TNSAPCC contributes to NDC as stated in NAPCC. Some movements and policies like MGNREGA, Jal Shakti Abhiyan etc and how TNSAPCC helps in achieving their goals.
- Climate profile of TN with prediction models for temp, precipitation and potential disasters in the upcoming years. This can include analysis of major risks and vulnerability.
- Then the main part of the presentation. The strategies in order to tackle these risks, climate change and how much budget should be allotted in order to implement these policies.
- The policies in different sectors like temperature, water bodies can be described separately.
- To conclude, we need to gather information about how these policies are being implemented today in real life(Not given in PDF) and what are the suggested changes we can come up with.
- We should include few examples here and there in order to make the ppt more interesting.

So the types of work we have are
- Gathering the information for each point mentioned above.
- Scrutinize the information and reform it in a presentable format.
- Preparing the information for verbal delivery. Splitting the topics among ourselves.
- Preparing the PPT creatively.
- IDK may be we need to include a video, but time constraint. Let's decide on this.
