## What is NAPCC?
National Action Plan for Climate Change(NAPCC, 2k08) is GOI's programme launched to mitigate and adapt to the adverse impact of climate change.

It was embedded with 8 sub-missions which are: 
-   National Solar Mission
-   National Mission for Enhanced Energy Efficiency
-   National Mission on Sustainable Habitat
-   National Water Mission
-   National Mission for Sustaining Himalayan Ecosystem
-   Green India Mission
-   National Mission for Sustainable Agriculture
-   National Mission on Strategic Knowledge for Climate Change

## Why NAPCC?
- The major challenge our country is facing now is sustaining its rapid economic growth while dealing with global threat of climate change. The causes of this threat are the long term anthropogenically generated GHGs, intensive industrial growth and high consumption lifestyles in developed countries. 

- India is a country whose economy is closely linked with its natural resource base and climate sensitive sectors such as agriculture, water and forestry. The projected changes in climate pose a direct(degradation of environment and natural climate cycle) and an indirect(Negative impact on economic growth which inturn affects the development of the country) threat.

- The official document states : "Our objective will be to establish an effective, cooperative and equitable global approach based on the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities, enshrined in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change(UNFCCC)."

- It is based on the principle of equity. The global approach must allow each inhabitant of the earth an equal entitlement to the global atmospheric resource. India is determined that its per capita greenhouse gas emissions will at no point exceed that of the developed countries even as we puruse our development objectives.

## Background
The Fourth Assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change(IPCC-AR4) concluded from the direct observations of changes in temperature, sea level, and snow cover in the northern hemisphere during 1850 to the present, that the warming of the earth's climate syswtem is unequivocal. 

## Timeline
• Mid-2007: The UPA government constituted the Prime Minister’s Council on Climate Change (PMCCC).

• June 2008: India hastily announced its National Action Plan on Climate Change      (NAPCC), a month before the G8 Summit.

• 2014: The new NDA government formed

• 2015: NAPCC met only once in the new dispensation.

• 2018 (Global Climate Risk Index): India listes the 12th most vulnerable country to climate change impacts.
